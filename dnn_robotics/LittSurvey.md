1. Cloud-Based Robot Grasping with the Google Object Recognition Engine, Ben Kehoe et al

Preprocessing: CAD model to Grasp analysis results in candidate grasps which are pre-computed and stored.
Uses 3D cad model and Point cloud to do Pose estimation. Pose estimation results in a set of feasible grasps.

2. Team Delftâ€™s Robot Winner of the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016

System acquires 3D(point cloud format) and RGB image. Does pose estimation using 4PCS technique.
